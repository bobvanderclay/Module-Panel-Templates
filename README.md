## About the template files

* The goal is to offer the template files in a consistent and uniform manner.
* All templates shall have at the very minimum 1 **Make_Model_Template.svg** file.

*Template folders may consist of multiple files such as [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/) project files or other relevant files.*
